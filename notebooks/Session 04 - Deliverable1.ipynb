    "### Objective\n",
    "In this homework, you will explore Bayesian inference using a real-world scenario: the 1997 chess match between Garry Kasparov and IBM's \n",
    "Deep Blue.  You will work through the Bayesian analysis step-by-step, understanding prior probabilities, likelihoods, posterior probabilities, and simulation.\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "In 1996, world chess champion (and human!) Gary Kasparov played a much anticipated six-game chess match against the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue. Of the six games, Kasparov won three, drew two, and lost one. Thus, Kasparov won the overall match, preserving the notion that machines don't perform as well as humans when it comes to chess. Yet Kasparov and Deep Blue were to meet again for a six-game match in 1997. Let π, denote Kasparov's chances of winning any particular game in the re-match. Thus, π is a measure of his overall skill relative to Deep Blue. Given the complexity of chess, machines, and humans, π is unknown and can vary or auctuate over time. Or, in short, π is a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we are investigating the probability of Garry Kasparov winning a game against IBM's Deep Blue. \n",
    "Using Bayesian inference, we update our beliefs about Kasparov's skill level based on prior knowledge and observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. **Think**: Think about the problem and define the value/s we want to estimate.\n",
    "1. **Prior Model**: We define initial beliefs about Kasparov's chances of winning a game before considering data.\n",
    "2. **Binomial Data Model**: We use a Binomial distribution to model the number of games he wins out of six played.\n",
    "3. **Likelihood Function**: We compute the probability of observing the actual game outcome for different win probabilities.\n",
    "4. **Posterior Probability Model**: Using Bayes' Rule, we update our belief about Kasparov's skill after observing the match.\n",
    "5. **Simulation**: We simulate possible match outcomes to verify our theoretical calculations."
