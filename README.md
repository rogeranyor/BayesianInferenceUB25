## ðŸ§  About the Course

This repository hosts the course materials for the **Bayesian Inference** subject in the Master's in Data Science program at the **University of Barcelona**.

Students will gain theoretical and practical foundations in Bayesian statistics, learning how to:
- Model uncertainty using probability
- Build and interpret Bayesian models
- Perform inference using tools like **PyMC**
- Evaluate model performance and communicate results

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To use the materials locally:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/enriquemoraayala/BayesianInferenceUB25.git
cd BayesianInferenceUB25
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\\Scripts\\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
If a `requirements.txt` file is provided:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If not, install key packages manually:
```bash
pip install pymc numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter arviz
```

### 4. Launch Jupyter
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the `notebooks/` directory and start exploring the content.
